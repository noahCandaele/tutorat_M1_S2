    "#### Re-structuration intelligente d'un jeu de donnée de debats politiques pour l'extraction de structures argumentaires\n",
    "\n",
    "L'objectif du travail à réaliser est de structurer des données nécessaires à l'étude des composantes et des relations au sein des débats politiques qui ont eu lieu lors des élections du président des États-Unis de 1960 à 2016. Les débats se présentent sous la forme d'un dialogue entre un candidat et l'autre, qui répondent aux questions posées par un orateur sur divers sujets tels que l'économie, la sécurité, l'éducation, la guerre, les soins de santé, etc. Chaque débat a été divisé en sections en tenant compte des différents sujets abordés.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tous les débats ont été annotés d'un point de vue argumentatif. Des annotations concernant les composantes argumentatives sont présentes à l'intérieur :\n",
    "- Conclusions\n",
    "- Prémisses\n",
    "et des annotations faisant référence aux relations entre ces deux composants :\n",
    "- Attaque\n",
    "- Soutien\n",
    "- Équivalent\n",
    "\n",
    "L'objectif du projet est de concevoir et implémenter une structure de données textuels qui soit facile à manipuler pour la réalisation d'une des nombreuses tâches du TAL, à savoir l'extraction d'arguments.\n",
    "Plus précisément, il s’agit de deux structures :\n",
    "1) Un jeu de données référençant les composants (Claim, Premise) représentés par les colonnes suivantes :\n",
    "- Ligne de dialogue\n",
    "- Composants de l'argumentation\n",
    "- Schéma BIO des composants\n",
    "- Caractéristiques linguistiques, lexicales, grammaticales, syntaxiques, etc... (Chaque caractéristique séparée par une colonne) concernant le composant considéré\n",
    "2) Un ensemble de données se référant aux relations (Attaque, Soutien, Équivalent) regroupées par section et représentées par les colonnes suivantes :\n",
    "- Composante 1 (Claim/Premise)\n",
    "- Composante 2 (Claim/Premise)\n",
    "- Type de relation (Attaque/Soutien/Équivalent)\n",
    "- Schéma BIO des composants et des relations avec leur distance\n",
    "- Caractéristiques linguistiques, lexicales, grammaticales, syntaxiques, etc. (chaque caractéristique séparée par une colonne) concernant la relation considérée"
